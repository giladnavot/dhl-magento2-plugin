title: Runtime Adaptability of the Admin View
---
This document will cover how the system handles changes in the Admin View at runtime, such as when changing shipping options. We'll cover:

1. The role of the `ChangeShippingMethodName` class
2. How the `adminhtml_order_shipment_new.xml` layout file contributes to this process.

# The Role of the ChangeShippingMethodName Class

The `ChangeShippingMethodName` class is part of the DHLParcel Shipping plugin. It is constructed with a `TimeSelectionFactory` object and a `Data` helper object. The `TimeSelectionFactory` object is used to create time selection instances, which could be related to the shipping options.

```hack
class ChangeShippingMethodName
{
    /**
     * @var TimeSelectionFactory
     */
    protected $timeSelectionFactory;

    /**
     * @var Data
     */
    protected $helper;

    public function __construct(
        TimeSelectionFactory $timeSelectionFactory,
        Data $helper
    ) {
        $this->timeSelectionFactory = $timeSelectionFactory;
        $this->helper = $helper;
    }
```

# The adminhtml_order_shipment_new.xml Layout File

This layout file defines the structure of the new shipment page in the admin view. It includes a CSS file for styling the shipping options and a JavaScript file for handling interactions with these options. The `dhlparcel_shipping_shipment_create` block is defined here, which uses the `DHLParcel\Shipping\Block\Adminhtml\Order\Shipment\Create` class and the `DHLParcel_Shipping::order/shipment/create.phtml` template. This block could be responsible for displaying and handling changes to the shipping options.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
