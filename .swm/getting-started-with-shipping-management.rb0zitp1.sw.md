title: Getting Started with Shipping Management
---
Shipping in the DHL Magento 2 plugin refers to the process of managing and handling the delivery of orders. The `Controller/Adminhtml/Shipment` directory contains various PHP files that handle different aspects of the shipping process. For instance, `Download.php` might be responsible for downloading shipping-related documents, `Labelrequest.php` could be handling requests for shipping labels, `PrintAction.php` might be managing the printing of shipping labels, `UndoShipped.php` could be used to revert a shipment status, and `Capabilities.php` might be checking the capabilities of the shipping service. The `Shipment` namespace is used across these files, indicating that they share common functionalities related to shipping. The `Data` alias is used to access helper functions related to shipping data, while the `ShipmentRepository` alias is used to interact with the shipment data in the database. The `Order` alias is used to handle order-related services.
