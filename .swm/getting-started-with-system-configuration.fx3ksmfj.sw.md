title: Getting Started with System Configuration
---
System Configuration in the DHL Magento 2 plugin refers to the settings and parameters that determine how the plugin operates within a Magento 2 store. It includes settings related to DHL services, such as shipping options, label printing, and region-specific configurations. These settings are accessible and modifiable through the Magento 2 admin panel, allowing store administrators to customize the plugin's functionality to best suit their store's needs and their customers' preferences.
