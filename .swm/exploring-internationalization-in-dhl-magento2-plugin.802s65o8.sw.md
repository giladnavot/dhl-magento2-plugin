title: Exploring Internationalization in DHL Magento2 Plugin
---
Internationalization, often abbreviated as i18n, is the process of designing a software application so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes. In the context of the dhl-magento2-plugin, internationalization is implemented through the use of language-specific CSV files located in the i18n directory. These files contain key-value pairs where the key is a string in English and the value is the translated string in the target language. This allows the plugin to support multiple languages and can be easily extended to new languages by adding more CSV files.

# CSV Files for Internationalization

This CSV file contains key-value pairs of English text and their translations. Each line represents a different piece of text that is used in the plugin. When the plugin needs to display a piece of text, it looks up the translation in this file based on the user's language setting.

```csv

# Translation Example

This is an example of a translation file for Dutch language. Each line corresponds to a line in the English CSV file. The plugin would use this file to display text in Dutch when the user's language setting is Dutch.

```csv
"Additional transport insurance. If the value of the goods exceeds â‚¬ 50.000, please contact our Customer Service prior to shipping.",Aanvullende transportverzekering. Neem eerst contact op met de klantenservice als de waarde van uw zending hoger is dan â‚¬ 50.000
